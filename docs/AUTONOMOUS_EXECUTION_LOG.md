# Autonomous execution log

One short entry per block, newest last. Dates are 2026-10-27 (local time).

## Block 0: the first version (video, production, Devpost texts)

- Production deployed twice (scan frame and "fit to my reach"; then the frame and reach dots in the transparent pass,
  because an opaque frame was drawn under the UIKit panels and did not show). Production check: plan in about 2 s.
- Video re-recorded against production: 155 s, 19 beats, with a beat for steady aim, one switch and "fit to my reach".
- Local commits: video markers, scan frame, fit to my reach, draw-order fix, the video beat, gallery marker fix,
  submission texts.

## Block 1: YouTube

- The 19 MB file was split into three byte-exact parts (the browser tool uploads at most 10 MB per call), rebuilt inside
  YouTube Studio and checked there by SHA-256 against the original before it was handed to the uploader.
- Title and description from `docs/SUBMISSION.md` ("Video (YouTube)"), not made for kids, **Public**.
  Public link: https://youtu.be/jtqAi3gl-os (YouTube's oEmbed answers 200, so it is visible without signing in).

## Block 2: Devpost

- Video link switched from the previous cut to the new one; saved, and the public page embeds the new video.
- Gallery: the 9 old stills removed, the 11 new ones kept in story order (the cover with the user's mum first). Devpost
  keeps the order of the form's `photo_ids[]`, which is only changed by its own drag handler; it was driven with
  synthetic mouse events and read back from a fresh page load.
- Additional info: capabilities, hand interactions and "future of VR" replaced with the texts in `docs/SUBMISSION.md`.
  The four contest declarations were already ticked by the user from the original submission and were not changed;
  saving the page left them as they were. The project is still shown as SUBMITTED, 5/5 steps.

## Block 3: performance gate

- The gate (`npm run test:perf`) failed at 32 to 34.9 ms (whole frame, p95) against 29.4 ms. The code is not the cause:
  the October 23 commit, which passed at 25.2 ms that day, measures 34.9 ms on this machine now (same Intel UHD 630).
  The app's own systems are 2.1 ms p95 against a 3 ms budget.
- Profile of the worst-case workspace (3x throttle, 8 s): pointer raycasts 22%, render 32%, `PanelUISystem.update` walking
  the whole scene every frame 4.4% (framework code), and 4.3% in the IWER emulator's `gl.getParameter` (absent on a real
  Quest, counted by the gate).
- Fix: `src/ui/panel-ui-cache.ts` keeps the list of UIKit documents and re-collects it every 8 frames and when a panel
  is configured, instead of two scene walks and a new Set per frame. Median frame 19.5 to 18.1 ms.
- The p95 still varies between 30.0 and 33.1 ms from one run to the next on the same code, so on this machine the gate is
  not met yet.
