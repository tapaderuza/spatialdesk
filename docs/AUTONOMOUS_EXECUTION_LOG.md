# Autonomous execution log

One short entry per block, newest last. Dates are 2026-10-27 (local time).

## Block 0: the first version (video, production, Devpost texts)

- Production deployed twice (scan frame and "fit to my reach"; then the frame and reach dots in the transparent pass,
  because an opaque frame was drawn under the UIKit panels and did not show). Production check: plan in about 2 s.
- Video re-recorded against production: 155 s, 19 beats, with a beat for steady aim, one switch and "fit to my reach".
- Local commits: video markers, scan frame, fit to my reach, draw-order fix, the video beat, gallery marker fix,
  submission texts.

## Block 1: YouTube

- The 19 MB file was split into three byte-exact parts (the browser tool uploads at most 10 MB per call), rebuilt inside
  YouTube Studio and checked there by SHA-256 against the original before it was handed to the uploader.
- Title and description from `docs/SUBMISSION.md` ("Video (YouTube)"), not made for kids, **Public**.
  Public link: https://youtu.be/jtqAi3gl-os (YouTube's oEmbed answers 200, so it is visible without signing in).

## Block 2: Devpost

- Video link switched from the previous cut to the new one; saved, and the public page embeds the new video.
- Gallery: the 9 old stills removed, the 11 new ones kept in story order (the cover with the user's mum first). Devpost
  keeps the order of the form's `photo_ids[]`, which is only changed by its own drag handler; it was driven with
  synthetic mouse events and read back from a fresh page load.
- Additional info: capabilities, hand interactions and "future of VR" replaced with the texts in `docs/SUBMISSION.md`.
  The four contest declarations were already ticked by the user from the original submission and were not changed;
  saving the page left them as they were. The project is still shown as SUBMITTED, 5/5 steps.

## Block 3: performance gate

- The gate (`npm run test:perf`) failed at 32 to 34.9 ms (whole frame, p95) against 29.4 ms. The code is not the cause:
  the October 23 commit, which passed at 25.2 ms that day, measures 34.9 ms on this machine now (same Intel UHD 630).
  The app's own systems are 2.1 ms p95 against a 3 ms budget.
- Profile of the worst-case workspace (3x throttle, 8 s): pointer raycasts 22%, render 32%, `PanelUISystem.update` walking
  the whole scene every frame 4.4% (framework code), and 4.3% in the IWER emulator's `gl.getParameter` (absent on a real
  Quest, counted by the gate).
- Fix: `src/ui/panel-ui-cache.ts` keeps the list of UIKit documents and re-collects it every 8 frames and when a panel
  is configured, instead of two scene walks and a new Set per frame. Median frame 19.5 to 18.1 ms.
- The p95 still varied between 28.7 and 33.1 ms from one run to the next on the same code; the run inside the push hook
  met the gate (block 4).

## Block 4: git push

- Full suite after the panel cache: 133 passed (8.6 min). `git push origin main` ran the pre-push hook (`npm run ci`:
  typecheck, the whole suite, size check) with no `--no-verify`, and passed; the gate measured p50 16.9 ms and
  p95 28.7 ms (limit 29.4), 78 draw calls, 78 bytes allocated per frame.
- Remote: `50c539c..a5039d6  main -> main`. Nothing left ahead or behind.
- The margin is thin. Across the five gate runs of this session the same code gave p95 between 28.7 and 33.1 ms, because
  the tail depends on the laptop's state (the October 23 commit measured 34.9 ms here today). A next push can fail the
  gate on a bad run and pass on a retry; the right fix then is to re-measure Meta's reference scene on the same day.

## Block 5: the three features for the jury (audit, no new scope)

Frozen at three, as asked. Each one already exists and has its own tests; none was rewritten, so none was put at risk
the night before the submission is judged.

1. **Surface anchoring (Scene API):** `src/room/fit.ts` puts the working board on the detected desk or table at arm's
   length, the timer and the plant on it, the parked boards on the walls clear of doors and windows, with a persistent
   anchor; tested in all 13 synthetic rooms (`tests/rooms.spec.ts`, `tests/room.spec.ts`).
2. **Fit to my reach:** one pinch gives reach, height and side (`src/accessibility/reach.ts`, `reach-system.ts`,
   `tests/reach.spec.ts`: arithmetic, voice phrases, the XR flow, cancel).
3. **Reduced cognitive focus:** during a focus block the parked boards move to the far slots (2.4 to 2.6 m, `Layout.kt`)
   and the world beyond 1.25 m dims (`src/studio/focus-bubble.ts`, `tests/companion.spec.ts`).

Not done: anchoring the board to a bed or sofa. Fit room looks for a horizontal surface at desk height (0.55 to 1.15 m)
and a sofa seat is lower; it needs its own rule and tests across the rooms, so it is left as the next step.
